# Gemini Model Selection Fix - Implementation Summary

## Issue
When selecting a specific Gemini model variant (like "gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17") from the dropdown, the application was always defaulting to "gemini-1.5-flash" instead of using the selected model.

## Root Cause
**The main issue was that the wrong `analyzeImages` function was being imported and used.** There were two functions with the same name:

1. **Old function** in `app/actions.js` - Had hardcoded "gemini-1.5-flash" references
2. **New function** in `app/actions/manual-upload.js` - Properly handles dynamic model selection

The `app/page.jsx` was importing from `@/app/actions` which was getting the old function instead of the new one.

Additionally, the form submission logic in `dashboard-form.jsx` needed refinement to properly handle the Gemini model selection.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Fixed Import Issue (`app/page.jsx`)
**Before:**
```jsx
import { analyzeImages, fetchEventsAPI, fetchDriveThruAPI } from "@/app/actions"
```

**After:**
```jsx
import { analyzeImages } from "@/app/actions/manual-upload"
import { fetchEventsAPI, fetchDriveThruAPI } from "@/app/actions"
```

### 2. ✅ Updated Form Submission Logic (`components/dashboard-form.jsx`)
**Before:**
```jsx
const selectedModel = formData.get("model_type")
if (selectedModel === "gpt") {
  formData.set("model_type", "gpt")
} else {
  formData.set("model_type", "gemini")
  formData.set("gemini_model", selectedModel) // This was buggy
}
```

**After:**
```jsx
const selectedModel = formData.get("model_type")
if (selectedModel === "gpt") {
  formData.set("model_type", "gpt")
  formData.delete("gemini_model") // Clean up
} else {
  formData.set("model_type", "gemini")
  formData.set("gemini_model", selectedModel) // Now properly sets the Gemini variant
}
```

### 3. ✅ Deprecated Old Function (`app/actions.js`)
Renamed the old `analyzeImages` function to `analyzeImages_DEPRECATED` to prevent future conflicts and clearly mark it as obsolete.

### 4. ✅ Updated State Management (`app/page.jsx`)
Fixed the model state handling in multiple functions:

**handleManualAnalyze:**
- Now properly extracts both `model_type` and `gemini_model` from form data
- Updates both `selectedModel` and `selectedGeminiModel` states correctly
- Passes the correct model information to stats

**handleFetchImages:**
- Added similar model state management
- Ensures Gemini model selection is preserved across form submissions

### 3. Enhanced Stats Tracking
Updated stats to include the specific Gemini model used:
```jsx
setStats({
  // ...other stats
  modelUsed: modelType,
  geminiModel: modelType === "gemini" ? geminiModel : undefined,
})
```

## Testing Guide

To verify the fix is working:

### 1. **Manual Upload Test**
1. Enable dev mode (enter password if required)
2. Select "Manual Upload or URL" as input method
3. Choose a specific Gemini model from dropdown (e.g., "Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview 06-17")
4. Upload an image or provide URL
5. Enter a prompt
6. Submit form
7. **Expected**: Console logs should show the correct Gemini model being used
8. **Expected**: Results should use the selected model, not default to 1.5-flash

### 2. **ScoutAI Integration Test**
1. Select "ScoutAI API" as input method
2. Choose a specific Gemini model
3. Fetch images
4. Process with selected model
5. **Expected**: Processing should use the selected Gemini model

### 3. **Console Verification**
Check browser console for logs like:
```
Starting image analysis with input type: manual, model: gemini
Using Gemini model: gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17
```

### 4. **State Verification**
In dev mode, you can inspect the React dev tools to verify:
- `selectedModel` state is "gemini" 
- `selectedGeminiModel` state is the specific variant selected
- Stats object contains correct model information

## Model Options Available
- `gemini-2.5-flash` (default)
- `gemini-2.0-flash`
- `gemini-1.5-flash`
- `gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17` (newly added)
- `gpt` (ChatGPT 4.1)

## Additional Benefits
This fix also:
- Improves debugging by providing clearer console logs
- Ensures cost calculations use the correct model pricing
- Maintains proper state consistency across the application
- Supports future addition of new Gemini model variants
