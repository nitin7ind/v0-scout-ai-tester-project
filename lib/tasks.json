      "id": "empty-bins",
      "name": "Empty bins",
      "prompt": "For compliance, you must detect if any bin is empty or running low. Identify all visible food bins and classify each as: Full (any food visibly present and the metal bottom of the bin is not clearly visible, even if the surface is uneven or a spoon is placed), Partial (only if the bin has large empty areas and the metal bottom is visible in at least one-third of the bin), or Empty (almost no food is visible and the bottom is mostly exposed). Spoons, prongs, shadows, and food gaps should be ignored when judging fullness. Be lenient: if food is covering most of the bin even with uneven surface, it is Full. Then apply this logic: If all bins are Full, return 'Full'. If even one bin is Empty, or if two or more bins are Partial, return 'Empty'. Output only one word: 'Full' or 'Empty'. No explanation or extra text."

Consider a bin 'empty' only if there is no food visible within it. Ignore any spoons, prongs, or shadows when assessing the presence of food. Even if 1 container is empty, consider final response to be empty.Reply in only a single word: Full or Empty."
